## I Was Busy Thinkin' 'Bout Birds

### Goals

My goal was to get the highest accuracy I could in the [Kaggle bird classifying competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birds22sp/). To achieve this I tested multiple combinations of neural networks with different optimization schemes and hyperparameters.

### Methodology

I started with the example code given by in class [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kHo8VT-onDxbtS3FM77VImG35h_K_Lav?usp=sharing), which served as a baseline for future experiments. The defult neural network is based off resnet18 and runs the SGD optimizer over 5 epochs, which yeilds a testing accuracy of 48%.
